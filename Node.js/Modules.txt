What is Module in Node.js?

-> Consider module to be the same as Javascript Libarires
->  A set of function you want to include in your application

Include Modules 

->  To Include a module, use the require()  function with the name  of the module:

Example :

 var  http = require('http);

 -> Now your Application has access to the HTTP Module, and is able to create a server: 


 htttp.createServer( function (req, res) {
    res.writeHead(200, {
        "Content-Type" : 'text/html'
    });
    res.end("Helo world");
 }).listen(8080);

Create Your Own Module 


exports.MyDateTime = function () {
    return Date();
}
