1. What is React ?

React is a Javascript library for building user interfaces, Particularly  single page Applications where data chenges over time  . 

-> Jordan Walke , 2011
-> React Current version : React 18

How React Works?

-> React uses Component based Architecture, where UI divided into small reusable pieces called components.  
-> Each Component manages its own state and re-render UI based on state
-> React updates and renders only the necessary components when data changes  

2. What are te Key features of  React 

-> JSX (Javascript Syntax Extension or XML) - write html like code within Javascript 
-> Virtual DOM 
-> One-Way Data Binding
-> Component Based Architecture

3. What is JSX

-> JSX stands for Javascript XML. It allows developers  to write HTML elments directly within Javascript code. 
-> JSX transpiled to Javascript using Babel

4. What is the Virtual DOM

-> The Virtual DOM is an memory representation of the actual DOM elements generated by React Components
-> When state of an object changes, React First Updates the  Virtual DOM , It then compares the virtual DOM with a snapshot of the  previos  virtual (Diffing) and calculates theminimal number of changes required to update the actual DOM 

5. What is Components ?

-> Componets are the Building blocks of a react Application

Types of Components
-> Functional Components
-> Class Components

6. What are props in React ?

-> Props short for properties are read only input passed to a React Component
-> They are used to pass  data from  one component to another , Typically from a parent componet to a child componet

Example :

  function Greeting (props)  {
   
   return <h1> hello , {props.name}</h1>
     
  }


  Function App() {

    return (
        <>
        <Greeting name="Ajay" />
        <Greeting  name="Jeeva"/>


        </Greeting>
    )
  }

7. What is state in React?

-> State is a built in Object , That store property values that belongs to the Component 
-> when state object changes , the componet re-renders , reflecting  the new state in the  UI
-> State is Managed within the Component


Example :

import { useState }  from 'react'

function Counter() {
    const [count,setCount] = useState(0)

    return (
        <div>
          <p> You Clicked {count} times </p>
          <button onClick={ () => setCount(count + 1 )}>Click Me</button>
        </div>
    )
}

8.  What is the purpose of render() in React?

-> The render() method is part of class component in React,  it return the react elements that describes what the ui should look like, 
-> The render() method is called whenever the componets state or props change ,  ensuring the ui stays in sync with data 


9. What are Hooks?

-> React hooks are functions that let you use state and  other React features in functional components, 
-> Hooks allow functional componets to manage state and side effects 

Common Hooks
-> useState - Manages state in Functional Components
-> useEffect - Handles side effects like data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM 

10. What is useState ?

-> UseState is a React Hook that allows functional components to manage state , 
-> It returns an with two elements, The current state value and a function to  update it. By calling the setter function , you can update the state , which triggers a re - render of the component with new state 

example = const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
